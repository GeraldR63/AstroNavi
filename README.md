README

One point at the beginning: All of this looks very complicated but it isn't. You can solve the Astronavigational Problem simple up to as complex as possible. It depends on your sighting and requirements. If you are at open water than it's probably not required to know your position exactly. If you are nearby shallow water or a reef it probably matters. However this method give you the chance to have a very fast calculation using just basic arithmetic and also much more complex spheric geometry. But look at the Excel. Even someone having no clue of spheric geometry can use the template to do all of the math. Print the spreadsheet and go on. This software is designed to check humans calculation.

MOST RECENT VERSION WILL BE FOUND IN THE MASTER BRANCH! The MAIN branch will be updated by me only after major changes.

This is a simple AstroNavigation utility.
It's designed for Blue Water Sailors and Professionals using Nautical Almanac or Long Term Almanac
plus a Watch, Sextant.


This App works on Android Mobile Phones like HUAWEI ATU-L21. That's my development platform.
Maybe it will work on other devices but I was not able to check this.


This software come with no warranty.
It's designed as best as possible. The given example of the Nautical Almanac 2022 is calculated correct.
Small differences come from using up to 16 figures after the decimal point. The NA calculates with 5.


Download just "app-release.apk". I guess that your mobile will install it automatically.
See: https://github.com/GeraldR63/AstroNavi/blob/master/app/release/app-release.apk for most recent.

This APP is under construction. Planned are to generate a complete "Sight Reduction Form" as required for a logbook plus a calculation without using a book like Nautical Almanac or Long Term Almanac. But that's bad practise. Computers help humans. We are not the slaves of computers. That's the major mistake younger people make by using computers. My software supports Navigators but the goal is not to make them stupids.

I attached also an ooCalc document which can also be used by Navigators. It's doing the same but shows each calculation step. It also contains an empty sheet with instructions how to calculate everything by yourself.

Process flow to get and calculate a position by classic Astronavigation.
