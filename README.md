This is signed and do not require any access to your private data. I can not guarantee that this App is not spyware but I will try my very best to avoid loss of users privacy.

This is an app for navigators. Not more and not less.


I'm working on some parts up to now. Next release will generate printable "Sight Reduction Forms" and than I will implenent an Almanac independent calculation which is NOT recommended to use.
