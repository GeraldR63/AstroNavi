MOST RECENT VERSION WILL BE FOUND IN THE MASTER BRANCH! The MAIN branch will be updated by me only after major changes.

This is a simple AstroNavigation utility.
It's designed for Blue Water Sailors and Professionals using Nautical Almanac or Long Term Almanac
plus a Watch, Sextant.


This App works on Android Mobile Phones like HUAWEI ATU-L21. That's my development platform.
Maybe it will work on other devices but I was not able to check this.


This software come with no warranty.
It's designed as best as possible. The given example of the Nautical Almanac 2022 is calculated correct.
Small differences come from using up to 16 figures after the decimal point. The NA calculates with 5.


Download just "app-release.apk". I guess that your mobile will install it automatically.

This APP is under construction. Planned are to generate a complete "Sight Reduction Form" as required for a logbook plus a calculation without using a book like Nautical Almanac or Long Term Almanac. But that's bad practise. Computers help humans. We are not the slaves of computers. That's the major mistake younger people make by using computers. My software supports a Navigator but the goal ist not to make them stupids.

I attached also an ooCalc document which can als be used by Navigators. It's doing the same but shows each calculation step. It also contains an empty sheet with instructions how to calculate everything by yourself.
