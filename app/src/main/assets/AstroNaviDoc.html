You will find the most valid documentation for this utility<br>
at "https://github.com/GeraldR63/AstroNavi".<br>
Credentials: Pyhtagoras, Euklid, Keppler, Gauss, Newton,<br>
Aristides M. Bonanos, P.Lutus, John Clark Craig, David Burch,<br>
Geoffrey Kolbe, Konrad Zuse, Ada Lovelace, Adam Riese
and last but not least most important today  Jean Meeus.<br>
<br>
The process is:<br>
1. Plan your Sighting by using AstroNavi!<br>
2. Measure CB's by pre adjusted Sextant. Measure time only!<br>
3. Write down exact time DD.MM.YYYY HH:MI:SS<br>
4. Go to your nav room<br>
5. Fill in Date/Time/Heading/Speed/CB Name/Date and Time<br>
6. Take figures like GHA Aries, SHA, Declination from NA<br>
7. Calculate figures until they are good (Iteration!)<br>
8. Print Sight Reduction Form, sign it and add it to Log Book.<br>
<br>
You can also use as a first step the given example of<br>
the Nautical Almanac 2022 by pressing "EXAMPLE NA", than <br>
"CALC" to get the first iteretion. Press "CALC" again to<br>
get additional iterations. Than print.<br>
Allowed DMS Format is very powerful.<br>
