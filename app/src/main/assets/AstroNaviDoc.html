2. Measure CB's by Sextant<br>
3. Write down exact time DD.MM.YYYY HH:MI:SS<br>
4. Go to your nav room<br>
5. Fill in Date/Time/Heading/Speed/CB Name/Date and Time<br>
6. Take figures like GHA Aries, SHA, Declination from NA<br>
7. Calculate figures until they are good<br>
8. Print Sight Reduction Form, sign it and add to Log Book.<br>
<br>
You can also use as a first step the given example of<br>
the Nautical Almanac 2022 by pressing "EXAMPLE NA", than <br>
"CALC" to get the first iteretion. Press "CALC" again to<br>
get additional iterations. Than print.<br>
The "HO2HC" button give the possibilty to add corrections.<br>
Allowed DMS Format is very powerful:<br>
00.5'30.00" is same as 01.0'00.00".<br>
